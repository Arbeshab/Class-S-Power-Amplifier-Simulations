Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB component because the site type selected is not compatible. 

   Further explanation:
   The component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties consistent
   with input, output, or bi-directional usage and contains no other symbols or
   properties that require a more specific IO component type. Please double
   check that the types of logic elements and all of their relevant properties
   and configuration options are compatible with the physical site type of the
   constraint.

   Summary:
   Symbols involved:
   	BUF symbol "tx_out_n_OBUF" (Output Signal = tx_out_n)
   	PAD symbol "tx_out_n" (Pad Signal = tx_out_n)
   Component type involved: IOB
   Site Location involved: K2
   Site Type involved: OPAD

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:56 - Part 'xc5vfx70t' is not a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network enable_transmission_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 1 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   choose_signal_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:856 - PLL_ADV modulator_inst/my_pll_clock/PLL_ADV_INST CLKIN2 pin
   was disconnected because a constant 1 is driving the CLKINSEL pin.
INFO:MapLib:841 - Changing COMPENSATION attribute from SYSTEM_SYNCHRONOUS to
   INTERNAL for PLL_ADV modulator_inst/my_pll_clock/PLL_ADV_INST.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
